follow these instructions in order to link existing projects in DB with your github account

1. run the app and use single sign on
2. using rails console find out what your uid is
3. go to seeds.rb and fill in your uid in the indicated places (also, can fill in your name associated with the github as well if you want)
4. reset and reseed the DB
5. run the app again and sign in -- you should see projects
